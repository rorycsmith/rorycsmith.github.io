### Links
Method one:  Inline link, you wrap the link text in brackets [ ], and then you wrap the link in parenthesis ( ).

Method two:  Reference link    Here's [a link to something else][another place].
     Here's [yet another link][another-link].
     And now back to [the first link][another place].

     [another place]: www.github.com
     [another-link]: www.google.com

Images also have two styles, just like links, and both of them render the exact same way. The difference between links and images is that images are prefaced with ioan exclamation point ( ! ).

The first image style is called an inline image link. To create an inline image link, enter an exclamation point ( ! ), wrap the alt text in brackets ( [ ] ), and then wrap the link in parenthesis ( ( ) ). (Alt text is a phrase or sentence that describes the image for the visually impaired.)

For a reference image, you'll follow the same pattern as a reference link. You'll precede the Markdown with an exclamation point, then provide two brackets for the alt text, and then two more for the image tag. At the bottom of your Markdown page, you'll define an image for the tag.

>To create a block quote, all you have to do is preface a line with the "greater than" caret (>).  (note that even blank lines in the quote must have the caret (>).

To create an unordered list, you'll want to preface each item in the list with an asterisk ( * )

An ordered list is prefaced with numbers, instead of asterisks.

To nest lists:  All you have to do is to remember to indent each asterisk one space more than the preceding item.

soft breaks: separate lines by 2 spaces
